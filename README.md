    <header> <h2><u>Timeline of browsers </u></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1990</strong> &#8211; The WorldWideWeb (not to be confused with the World Wide Web) was the first browser ever created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.</li>
<li><strong>1992</strong> &#8211; Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn’t display any graphic content.</li>
<li><strong>1993 </strong>&#8211; Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it “the world’s first most popular browser”.</li>
<li><strong>1994</strong> &#8211; A noticeable improvement to Mosaic came Netscape Navigator.</li>
<li><strong>1995</strong> &#8211; Internet Explorer made its debut as Microsoft’s first web browser.</li>
<li><strong>1996</strong> &#8211; Opera started as a research project in 1994 that finally went public two years later. This was also arguably the beginning of the browser wars, mainly between IE 3 and Navigator 3 as Internet Explorer inched ahead with new capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>2003</strong> &#8211; Apple’s Safari browser was released specifically for Macintosh computers instead of Navigator.</li>
<li><strong>2004</strong> &#8211; Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator faded out.</li>
<li><strong>2007</strong> &#8211; Mobile Safari was introduced as Apple’s mobile web browser and continues to dominate the iOS market.</li>
<li><strong>2008</strong> &#8211; Google Chrome appeared to soon take over the browser market.</li>
<li><strong>2011</strong> &#8211; Opera Mini was released to focus on the fast-growing mobile browser market.</li>
<li><strong>2015</strong> &#8211; Microsoft Edge was born to combat Google.</li>
